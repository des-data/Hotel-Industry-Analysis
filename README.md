# 🚀 Leveraging Data Analytics for Hotel Industry Insights 🚀  

Welcome to my project where I harnessed data analytics techniques to derive actionable insights for the hotel industry! Using a publicly available dataset, I explored trends, identified key metrics, and developed interactive visualizations that answer real-world business questions.  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project showcases the use of **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI** to uncover insights from hotel industry data. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what was achieved:  

1. **Data Integration**:  
   - Combined data from three Excel sheets into a cohesive dataset using SQL for seamless analysis.  
   - Integrated additional data to enrich the dataset for comprehensive analysis.  

2. **Data Transformation**:  
   - Used a **Common Table Expression (CTE)** to streamline queries and create a unified, efficient dataset.  
   - Generated new metrics, such as revenue, by leveraging existing data on ADR (Average Daily Rate), week and weekend bookings, and discounts.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Conducted EDA to uncover trends and patterns in the data.  
   - Focused on key metrics like **revenue trends**, **car parking usage**, and **guest behavior**.  

4. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Connected the transformed dataset to **Power BI** for creating interactive dashboards.  
   - Developed visualizations to track:  
     - Yearly revenue trends  
     - Changes in Average Daily Rate (ADR)  
     - Booking patterns (weekend vs. weekday)  
     - Impact of discount strategies  

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- **Revenue Trends**: Is the hotel's revenue increasing year over year?  
- **Car Parking Usage**: Is there a need for additional parking spaces based on guest trends?  
- **Guest Behavior**: What booking patterns can inform marketing and operational decisions?  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and integration.  
- **Excel**: Initial data exploration and integration.  
- **Power BI**: For visualization and dashboard creation.  

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights  
The interactive dashboard developed in Power BI provides a clear picture of the hotel's performance, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.  

## 🌟 Lessons Learned  
This project was an excellent opportunity to apply data analytics techniques to real-world business challenges. It highlighted the importance of clean data, efficient query optimization, and meaningful visualizations in deriving actionable insights.
